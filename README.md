# odin-recipes
TOP recipe project
This is the first project with The Odin Project, starting with only HTML.
A later project will build on this project or add further functionality to this project.

HTML only - self-reflection:
> setting up the basic HTML boilerplate - setup from memory
> directory and file structure - learnt best-practice and correctly linked to files in different directories
> git and github via CLI - working git and github via the command line practiced
> git commit messages - need to check whether I have correctly worded commit messages vs TOP best-practice
> Linux - simplicity of Linux system is starting to become familiar
